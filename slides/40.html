    While easing the flow of deployment, these tools also paved the way for creating smaller applications that can communicate with each other, that can be independently developed,
    deployed, scaled and updated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating logical smaller applications also means that working in smaller teams. As well as these microapplications can be in any language or can run on any platform, if they
    can commincate across a common medium like message brokers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this was a common practice for large-scale projects of well-known tech giants to ensure global avalability and employ thousands of developers working in the same
    project, this practice can now be seen in many smaller scale and even personal projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventhough the flow of developing the actual application itself might be the same, the count of developers are drastically reduced due to these applications are micro
    applications as in scale of original monolithic architecture.
