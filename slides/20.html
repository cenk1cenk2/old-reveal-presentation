  <p>Although web needs no introduction, I think that I have to emphasize some points why web development needs to always evolve to catch up with the expectations.</p>
  <p>
    We know that it provides intuative access to any service from anywhere, this makes it a great platform to obtain new costumers without physically investing in a certain area.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the statistics I briefly mentioned on the paper itself, global internet usage and availability increasing exponentially.
  </p>
  <p>
    We all know that part but the interesting part is internet access through mobile devices is increasing its chunk of percentage between non-working age groups. Which indirectly
    means that one of the most important market will be the mobile in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    While desktop applications have no place in our phones, it needs interactive applications to replicate the functionality albeit it might be a web or mobile native application
    which requires a web-based backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most important factor for businesses that operate in or for the web is web is a self-driven industry now. All the services provided through it uses it's backbone
    while generic advancements in computer technology and telecommunications is very beneficial, it has turned in to a driving force of other industries instead of being a novelty
    that is dependent on other technologies.
  </p>

  <p>-----PUSH-----</p>

  <p>In return with always increasing requirements of creating more interactive applications, it is always evolving.</p>
  <p>For connected applications, mobile desktop and web applications usually use the same backend to exchange data with the servers.</p>
  <p>
    And now with the recent improvements in last 5 to 10 years, to a certain degree it is possible to create native desktop or mobile applications with only using web based
    frameworks.
