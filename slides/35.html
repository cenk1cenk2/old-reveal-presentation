  <p>With the increase of the developer count as it is required in a larger project, some problems might surface with this workflow.</p>
  <p>---PUSH---</p>
  <p>
    The most trivial one being, with many people working on the same project there will be more branching out which might cause conflicts.
  </p>
  <p>---PUSH---</p>

    While calling scripts with different programming langauge is possible, the core is mostly written using the language that is decided at the beginning. But other programming
    languages for a certain part of the application can have better libraries or even better performance in certain tasks.
  </p>
  <p>---PUSH---</p>
  <p>
    With many people working on the same project, there have to be a good coordination which requires meticolious planning. This planning can go very deep to be sure that there
    will be no conflicts. This will reduce the time for the actual development and reserve more for planning and meaningless meetings.
  </p>
  <p>---PUSH---</p>
  <p>
    It is usually the case when you are working with many other people, to prove your ideas to be worthy. So the developer is forced to not apply their ideas and creativity which
    reduces motivation as well as might lengthen the development time.
