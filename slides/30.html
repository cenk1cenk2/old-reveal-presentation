  <p>Developing a web application and working as teams are always a complicated task.</p>
  <p>Working in teams always requires harmony and coordination, this is very eminent in any kind of programing project.</p>
  <p>Larger teams may have friction between them since there is not only one true way of doing something while programming.</p>
  <p>Putting this aside, it is always been a seperate task to deploy the application itself as a end product.</p>
  <p>Thankfully while web development was advancing by itself, the tools that go along with it to ensure quality of code and deploy the application was also sharpened.</p>
  <p>These developer operation tools enabled to automate the process of ensuring code quality and deployment.</p>
  <p>
    You can see here a basic workflow while developing a web application with the argued best practices. But scale the count of developers with the size of the project.
