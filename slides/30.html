  <p>Working in teams always requires harmony and coordination.</p>
  <p>Larger teams may have friction between them since there is not only one true way of doing something while programming.</p>
  <p>Putting this aside, it is always been a seperate task to deploy the application itself as a end product which usually needs another team to interfere.</p>

  <p>This basic workflow shows what a common develop cycle goes through these days.</p>
  <p>The count of the developers working in the same project scales proportionally with the size of the project.</p>

  <p>A distrubuted source code management system is the heart of any modern development environment.</p>

  <p>After a developer is done with their part of work, they want to commit their work to the mainstream branch.</p>
  <p>
    There are hooks that run on certain actions like push, where coding style or automated tests have been configured to run to ensure quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the code is successfully pushed in to the upstream, contunious integration takes care of whether these checks of enforcing code style, automated tests, or if required
    building or transpiling is successfully done.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that if the work of the developer is finished, it can create a pull request where the source code will be combined with the initial branch it started from. This is
    usually be subjected to manual code review by the project leads.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the changes get accepted it will be merged in to the main branch, where it will trigger a different set of processes with the contunious deployment. This process enables to
    deploy an application to a specified development stage or production environment based on certain variables.This will go through any steps required like building,
    containizeration and even automated deployment with the help of developer operations tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    So as an end result, without any human intervention except for the reviews, this automated flow enables to have a set of testing environments as well as can automatically
    deliver a finished production version.
