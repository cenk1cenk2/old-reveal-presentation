    So before pressing on further I want to show you an example from the hypervisor i have been using for some time lately. The issue here is just compare the desktop and mobile interfaces. With the mobile interface there is no monitoring and most of the functions are stripped out and only starting,
    restarting and shuttingdown the machine is left.
