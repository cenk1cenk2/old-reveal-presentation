  <p>Hello and welcome to my presentation that will justify my thesis.</p>
  <p>I am Cenk Kilic.</p>
  <p>My topic is web design with the supervision of Mr. Denner.</p>
  <p>
    Web development is a ever-so important platform that is exponentially growing since the final application can easily reach the whole world with ease as well non-web based
    applications do need to exchange data with remote servers to enchance the experience.
  </p>
  <p>Web development was never a static area and never will be.</p>
  <p>
    This makes it ever-so important to catch the trends and predict where it is heading comparing to legacy industries since a web applications intended lifetime is much longer
    than the trends at a given time it is conceived.
  </p>
  <p>Having a fast evolving platform as in this cases causes literature to be outdated in mere couple of years.</p>
  <p>
    With this motivation, I wanted to conduct a wider field of view research omitting the variables like programming languages or certain tools and just going in to detail about
    structural changes that might happen in the area of the web development in the upcoming years.
