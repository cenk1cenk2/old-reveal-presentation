 <p>There is a great quote that I dearly enjoy, which I stumbled across upon a guys announcement of making his program free and public on reddit some time ago.</p>
 <p>It says that after one year of working on his application, he thinks that its in a state where it might be interesting to other people other them himself.</p>
 <p>I also use this application almost until the begining and I intend to do the same which is to share my application when I feel the same way that it might interest other people as well.</p>
