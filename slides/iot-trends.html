  <p>IOT as we all know about it, is a exponentially growing market considering that it is a relatively new market.</p>
  <p>There is a total estimated revenue of 221 billion dolars. Therefore it is not hard to foresee that variety of the manufacturers want a chunk out of this market.</p>
  <p>This gives birth to many no-name brands that pushes out products of varying quality to the market. Because of that, today there is an estimated 31 billion IOT devices online. And this is only the estimated part as well, since there is also many manufacturers that are not considered in these statistics.</p>
  <p>Since the market getting hotter every minute products with no intention before started to have Iot capabilities.</p>
  <p>--------------PUSH---------------</p>
  <p>Having this many brands in one particular market, brings problems with it.</p>
  <p>There is many problems that are considered in the researchs but we will focus on these two particullarly.</p>
  <p>The thing is there is no established standard worldwide for IOT devices. There is works for it and published standards but considering many products for IOT purposes manufactured in China and there is many no-name brands it is hard to establish common ground.</p>
  <p>So if you have devices from different manufacturers, you will have many apps in your phone that can communicate with them. Writing a one common application is not directly possible because these devices mostly have different interfaces to receive or send data.</p>
  <p>There is also security risks with your devices being connected to internet and these devices mostly have remote controlled features.</p>
  <p>Considering that you buy a security camera for your security not a person to watch you online.</p>
  <p>These devices mostly dont receive updates, therefore it is easier to break in to after a exploit has been found.</p>
  <p>--------------PUSH---------------</p>
  <p>So lets keep these particular problems in the back of our head because we intend to solve them for our use case only.</p>
