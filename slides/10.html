  <p>As this is an academic paper, the following research questions will be answered albeit it is not limited only to them.</p>
  <p>What were the past trends for developing for the web, therefore what can be the possible future trends?</p>
  <p>
    I usually thing that future is a reflection of the past therefore reoccurances of certain trends might happen while they have build over the good qualities that they already
    have.
  </p>
  <p>What programming languages are found easy to work with and what programming languages are mostly used by the developers?</p>
  <p>
    Web can be written in many programming languages that yields HTML, CSS and JavaScript as an end result. But one of the most importing thing for considering a programming
    language is it's compatability with certain project.
  </p>
  <p>What can be a viable workflow these days to develop a web application?</p>
  <p>
    While the development techniques for web has varied over time, this is also true for suplementary workflow that enables this application to be a product or have an end result.
    Although I insist on there are no rules of thumbs in web development, these suplementary actions proves it otherwise albeit it is considered to be in a different area.
  </p>
  <p>What will be the future of web development given that there are two distinct architectures of monolithic and microservices?</p>
  <p>
    With the urge of working with many people in one single project and to reach the whole world by the means of scaling the services, it has been a good practice to split a large
    application in to smaller parts by technology giants. But the case is this trend is catching on with smaller companies as well as individuals. So I think this is the most
    important question that needs to be answered for foreseeing the future of the web development.
