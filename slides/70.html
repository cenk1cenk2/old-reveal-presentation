  <p>I just briefly want to summarize the results that i obtained throughout the paper, even though they are mentioned in detail there.</p>
  <p>
    I think the most important thing for the future of web development is the cummulative effort of developers and some more popular approaches that does not go in the direction
    that community demands them to can wipe out from the programming community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frameworks make it easier for many to organize their minds and work in teams due their given structure and everybody needs to adapt to them instead of going their own way.
    Although we can call these frameworks generation 2 frameworks, there will be a better faster stronger frameworks in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Microservices proved their worth for technology giants and with the overheads getting smaller, frameworks natively supporting them, eventhough the initial setup is a bit harder
    it might be the way to go for smaller scale projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most important factors that will shape the future i think is modularity and plug and play capabilities. It is cumbursome between developers to copy paste old working
    code between projects, the best way to achieve this is creating smaller parts of application libraries instead of doing this manual labor job which will go hand in hand with
    the idea of microservices.
