  <p>So what do I aim for this thesis when it is completed.</p>
  <p>I aim to create common interface for IOT devices, Physical computers, virtualized servers which might use different hypervisors and remote servers.</p>
  <p>This might look a little ambitious considering even the brands behind them ignoring to design their own proper interfaces, but it is not intended to fully control these devices through the interface if they have interface of theirselves.</p>
  <p>Rather it will be a complementery interface for them to control the functions that are not very advanced and I frequently need to do on the go. For more advanced tasks it can redirect to the already established interfaces of these programs.</p>
  <p>---------PUSH---------</p>
  <p>What is to with IOT devices you might ask.</p>
  <p>This will be the more complete side of the project controling even more advanced functions of these devices.</p>
  <p>Because I am using an iphone with 16gbs of storage after my phone broke down and as you know its storage management, it is not possible to even install all different applications of variety brands of iot devices on it.</p>
  <p>So this shall be a common interface that I dont have to jump around to control variety of devices.</p>
  <p>-------PUSH------</p>
  <p>Again you might ask why not even use the interfaces of established programs on the server side, and use everythings respective interfaces for server control.</p>
  <p>These tools as I mentioned does not have a proper monitor interface and even if they have it is on the paid side of things.</p>
  <p>So this will be a place to monitor all the devices, and with all the devices I mean I can monitor multiple devices at once.</p>
  <p>Some basic functions like wakeonlan, which I mainly use for daily computers like my gaming computer or virtualized HTPC to watch movies and this stuff requires me to go through SSH to even wake them up. And with this day and age we are getting lazier to get up and press power button on a computer that is in an other room. Therefore with these basic functions like waking, sleeping, shutting down devices will be also implemented.</p>
  <p>Automation tools also have keeping alive the services built-in. But the problem is again with the interface. Eventhough I assume the services are always alive, sometimes problems happen and I need to restart them or somewhat. I use a custom supervisor to run all the services on those servers inside their respective docker containers. With this way utilizing what I already use, I can monitor all the services that are essential to run on the startup and monitor or manage them through a interface where I can see all my services inside a common interface, and just filter out services that are not essential to run at boot time.</p>
